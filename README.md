 # Why hasn't there been any updates?

The reason why there has barely been any activity with the website is because I want to fully redo the whole website from scratch where it's fully responsive, has a cleaner interface, file system, and look. I also want it to function for the user better. This is my very first website project, basically, so it's kind of trashy. I've learned a lot since then, and I'm starting to see this website as more "junkier" as per say. I want to re-create the website, THEN focus on adding more content to The Game Center/

**TL;DR:** I want to re-create the whole website from scratch for a better experience for the user.

Note that I am rather busy, so development of the website in only my free-time will take a bit. I may also use bootstrap for the first time in a actual project, the column function may come in handy :>
