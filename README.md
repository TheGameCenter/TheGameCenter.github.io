# MAJOR!

This project is nearly two years old, and note that I usually don't have that much time, this website was originally made so I could have cracked game download links to share with one of my computing classes in 2022 so I woudn't be tracked by my school's email system, and I wanted to test my HTML and CSS stills, which at that time was quite.. "garbage", I'd say. I rarely have spare freetime, I do have a job, I am a solo developer, and I am still in school, which is quite heavy for my shecule for me to set aside to create a clean looking website. Also I appreciate all the Australians and Japanese users, the U.S. is the source of where this began, and I appreciate all the users from Australia and Japan <3 
I'm not sure when this website will be updated, but hopefully it'll be done by sometime in 2024.

# TheGameCenter.github.io
 The Game Center offers unblocked games which does not require administrator or really anything to run, and that are adjusted for lower-end computers or laptops. Things such as Grand Theft Auto, Minecraft, or many types of web game applications that are completely free to download! * Please Star!  
 
 # Why hasn't there been any updates?

The reason why there has barely been any activity with the website is because I want to fully redo the whole website from scratch where it's fully responsive, has a cleaner interface, file system, and look. I also want it to function for the user better. This is my very first website project, basically, so it's kind of trashy. I've learned a lot since then, and I'm starting to see this website as more "junkier" as per say. I want to re-create the website, THEN focus on adding more content to The Game Center/

**TL;DR:** I want to re-create the whole website from scratch for a better experience for the user.

Note that I am rather busy, so development of the website in only my free-time will take a bit.

**What may be included?**

- Blog Page
- Tutorials
- Archietecture of Software and Programming Languages eg. Java 
- New Desktop Games
- New Web Games

Note that anyone may feel free to fork, this is just a little project and I'm fine with others benefitting from my work ;)

I am starting to get more motivated due to me realising that over 40+ unique users visit my site on the span of 12 hours, when I thought it was only a few of my classmates whom used this website, therefore I am starting to really work on The Game Center and improving it overall. I'm either doing homework, or working on this website, not much more. The reason why I'm not releasing everything after I finish said object; eg. a webpage is because I always tamper with EVERYTHING multiple times even after I say "Yup, this page looks good and is responsive" and I make easily over 100+ file edits a day, therefore it would just be lot easier for me to post everything at once. Plus, it would be weird having an iconsistant theme across a multitude of web pages. Same applies with colors, as the current public theme is more of a bluish, while the new theme is a red and gray theme.
