# TheGameCenter.github.io
 The Game Center offers unblocked games which does not require administrator or really anything to run, and that are adjusted for lower-end computers or laptops. Things such as Grand Theft Auto, Minecraft, or many types of web game applications that are completely free to download! * Please Star!  
 
 # Why hasn't there been any updates?

The reason why there has barely been any activity with the website is because I want to fully redo the whole website from scratch where it's fully responsive, has a cleaner interface, file system, and look. I also want it to function for the user better. This is my very first website project, basically, so it's kind of trashy. I've learned a lot since then, and I'm starting to see this website as more "junkier" as per say. I want to re-create the website, THEN focus on adding more content to The Game Center/

**TL;DR:** I want to re-create the whole website from scratch for a better experience for the user.

Note that I am rather busy, so development of the website in only my free-time will take a bit. I may also use bootstrap for the first time in a actual project, the column function may come in handy :>

(3/21/23)
I am starting to get more motivated due to me realising that over 40+ unique users visit my site on the span of 12 hours, when I thought it was only a few of my classmates whom used this website, therefore I am starting to really work on The Game Center and improving it overall. I'm either doing homework, or working on this website, not much more. The reason why I'm not releasing everything after I finish said object; eg. a webpage is because I always tamper with EVERYTHING multiple times even after I say "Yup, this page looks good and is responsive" and I make easily over 100+ file edits a day, therefore it would just be lot easier for me to post everything at once. Plus, it would be weird having an iconsistant theme across a multitude of web pages. Same applies with colors, as the current public theme is more of a bluish, while the new theme is a red and gray theme.
